# General Info

(None of this is final, just an example of what all we need to agree on. We can also amend this as we go.)

# Naming Conventions

- Repositories are to follow the naming convention of "\<classNumber\>-\<assignmentName\>". Example: "402-Project-1"

- Variables are in camelCase, with the first letter in lowercase unless it is refering to a Class.

# Best Practices

- The "main" branch is not to be commited directly to. When there is a change to be made, the developer makes a new branch off of main that they can work on and commit to as they please. When the change is ready, a pull request to main is made, and is approved by another developer when the task meets the definition of done (code reviewed, demo to PO, etc).
