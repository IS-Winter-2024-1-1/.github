# General Info

(None of this is final, just an example of what all we need to agree on. We can also amend this as we go.)

# Naming Conventions

- Repositories are to follow the naming convention of "\<classNumber\>-\<assignmentName\>". Example: "402-Project-1"

- Variables are in camelCase, with the first letter in lowercase unless it is refering to a Class. The name of the variable should clearly describe what value it is meant to hold, and easily distiguish it from similar variables. If you regularly find yourself asking "what was this for?" or "which one was this?", you have not named your variables well.
  - Iterables may be given single-character names (i, x, y, z). If you need to use multiple iterables simultaneously (such as in a nested "for" loop), give them unique and descriptive names (such as "personIterable", "customerIterable", "orderIterable", etc).

# Best Practices

- The "main" branch is not to be commited directly to. When there is a change to be made, the developer makes a new branch off of main that they can work on and commit to as they please. When the change is ready, a pull request to main is made, and is approved by another developer when the task meets the definition of done (code reviewed, demo to PO, etc). 
- Comments should be complete sentences and end with appropriate punctuation. With that being said, this isn't your American Heritage essay either. If something is important, EXPRESS IT!!! Have fun with your comments, and pretend you're actually talking to someone.
